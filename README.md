## Project Description

**Integration-Tests-Databases** is a test project designed to demonstrate integration testing with databases for console-based applications built using the .NET Core Framework and Entity Framework. 

## Key Concepts

- **Integration Testing**: Ensuring different parts of the application work together as expected.
- **Database Testing**: Verifying that the application correctly interacts with the database.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET Core**: The primary framework used for building the console applications.
- **SQL Server**: The database management systems used for storing application data.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM and database drivers for interacting with databases.
- **nUnit**: A unit-testing framework for .NET applications.

## Projects Included

- **ContactsConsoleApi**: Console program for simulating a contact book application.
- **ProductConsoleAPI**: Console program for simulating a product managing application. 
- **TownsConsoleApi**: Console program for simulating a town adress application.
- **ZooConsoleApi**: Console program for simulating a zoo managing application.

## Project Structure

- **ConsoleAPI**: The main project folder containing the console application and integration tests.
    - **ConsoleAPI.csproj**: Project file for the console application.
    - **Program.cs**: The main entry point of the application.
    - **DataAccess.cs**: The Entity Framework context for managing database operations.
    - **Data.cs**: The model representing the data structure.
    - **Business.cs**: Contains business logic for managing data.

- **ConsoleAPI.IntegrationTests.NUnit**: The test project folder containing integration tests.
    - **IntegrationTests.csproj**: Project file for the test project.
    - **TestContactDbContext.csproj**
